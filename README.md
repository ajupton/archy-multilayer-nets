Mutlilayer Social Networks Created from Archaeological Data

Repository for the creation and analysis of multilayer networks from archaeological data. Through various relational approaches to ceramic industry, it is possible to explore culture contact. That is, networks of interaction through cultural transmission, social identification, and economic interaction related to ceramic industry are modeled prior to and following a circa 1300 A.D. in-migration of Oneota tribal peoples into the chiefly Mississippian Late Prehistoric central Illinois River valley. Social interaction through cultural transmission is modeled based on socially-mediated morphological jar and plate attributes. Social identification is modeled based on stylistic decorations incised or trailed on plates. Economic interactions are modeled based on membership in compositional groups constructed using LA-ICP-MS geo-chemical anlaysis of jars and plates, and is indicative of overlapping resource exploitation areas, similar paste preparation regimes, and/or the exchange of finished vessels. These relational approaches to culture contact are modeled as a node-disjoint multilayer network to examine their individual and collective influence and overlap in structuring Oneota in-migration and revealing behavioral response trends to multi-cultural regional co-habitation succeeding in-migration.
